/*Functions are objects

Every function is a special kind of object.

Why? Because a function in JS can:

Be called like fn()

Also have properties like fn.name, fn.length, or even custom ones like fn.version = 1.0.

 But not all objects are functions

A plain object like:

const user = { name: "Vikas" };


is not callable — you can’t do user().

It can only store properties/data/methods.*/
